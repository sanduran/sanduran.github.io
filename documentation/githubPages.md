# DOCUMENTATION
### Creating my own website using github pages
I made this page to document my CSP AP school projects. This was my first time using github so I had to learn everything from the start.

Challenges I faced: Learning githup from the basics was not too hard but I had a few roadblocks. Many features that I wanted to implement had me searching in google and chatGPT to find what I was looking for. I wanted a clean file structure so I looked at other peoples github pages and used some ideas from those. I also wanted to implement gifs so I used other websites to create gifs.
