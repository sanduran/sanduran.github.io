# DOCUMENTATION
### Simple Clock using ForEach() and Random()
I made this clock to learn about the ForEach() and Random() functions in Swift. The make my codee simpler because I dont need to write repetitive things when I can just use ForEach() and I can use Random() to get random numbers. While learning about random(), I learned that there is no true randomness in programming and that random functions generate semi-random outputs. Basically numbers that are not actoually random but seem random because of some complicated operations.
When designing this clock, the biggest problem I faced was understanding about ranges. Both ForEach and Random use ranges as inputs so ranges were essential to completing this project.
While making this I realised that Swift's ForEach and Random functions are very similar to Scratch's "repeat" and "pick random" blocks. ForEach and repeat are similar because you can execute a piece of code multiple times while only writing it once and Random and pick random are similar because tthey are both used to generate a random input.
