### Simple XOX using Scratch
This is a simple game I made for my CSP AP class to learn the basics of design and project managing. It was my first time using scratch so I had to learn the basics.

How it works:
Each sprite has a custom local variable "state" that stores if it is an X, O or empty. When the sprite is clicked it changes and based on that changes its costume. To achieve this, I used if blocks to check which state the sprite was currently at and then I assigned a new value to the custom variable.
