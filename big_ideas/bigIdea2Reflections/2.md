# BIG IDEAS
### Big Idea 2 Reflection
This big idea is about data compression. I learned that compressing data means that it will take less space on a computer and can be transferred faster. Data can be compressed in two ways: lossy compression and lossless compression. During lossy compression, some bits of information are lost in order to have better compression. Lossless compression can be better when preserving all the data is important because although it doesn’t compress as much, it keep all information intact and can be restored fully after compression. Computers compress data all the time even if we aren’t aware. When sending or storing files, computers compress the files so that they take less space and are faster to send.
