# BIG IDEAS
### Big Idea 4 Reflection
This big idea is about using programs with data. I learned that using programs to analyse data gives us valuable information and insight for a set of data. Using programs also helps us find patterns in sets of data. Programs can also be used to turn data into graphs or tables and we can use those to better communicate with others and better interpret the data.
