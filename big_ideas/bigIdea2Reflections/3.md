# BIG IDEAS
### Big Idea 3 Reflection
This big idea is all about extracting information from data. The first thing I learned is that data may need cleaning. Data cleaning means getting rid of invalid, incomplete or repeating data. Unclean data makes it harder to process and actually extract information from data so cleaning data is essential. THe second thing I learned is metadata. Metadata is all information in a file that is not the main payload like the date at which a photo was taken or the name of the photographer or the author of a book. All of those are not the main contents of the data but they help us when organizing and processing data.
