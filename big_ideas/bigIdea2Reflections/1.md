# BIG IDEAS
### Big Idea 1 Reflection
This big idea is all about binary numbers and storing data in binary. I learned that all data stored in our computers and the internet is binary. Binary can be used to store text, numbers, images and even sound or videos. Computers use binary because it is really easy to represent digitally, no power going through a cable is 0/off  and power is 1/on. Binary systems matter because they can efficiently store and transmit information in computers and the internet. For example if we want to upload an image to social media, it gets transferred with binary and when viewing the image from the internet it arrives as binary.
