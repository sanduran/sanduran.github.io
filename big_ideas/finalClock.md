First things first we had to find a target audience and we cose teenagers because we are teenagers. After that we collected some ideas through google and put them on a Figjam ideas board.

We decided on two that we liked most.

After the idea collecting phase we started making a desig for the clock. We took the hands of the first clock and the colors of the second and mixed them together.

The next step was doing the programming. For that I used the code of my [previous clock project](https://sanduran.github.io/projects/swiftClock) and made some adjustments.
